# **Group-Saisys-RouteXplorer**

Your path, redefined.

## **Overview**

**RouteXplorer** is an enhanced routing and visualization web application built on the **GraphHopper API**.
It provides interactive route maps, vehicle-specific KPIs, and turn-by-turn navigation ‚Äî ideal for transportation and logistics demonstrations in the Philippine context.

This project extends a previous CLI-based routing tool into a fully interactive browser interface with real-time visualization, fuel and energy estimations, and dynamic travel metrics.

## **Features**

* **Interactive Web Interface** ‚Äì Clean and intuitive HTML/CSS/JS front end with live route generation
* **Visual Route Mapping** ‚Äì Leaflet map display with start and destination markers (pin and green flag)
* **Multiple Vehicle Types** ‚Äì Supports car, motorcycle, bike, foot, and e-bike routing modes
* **Dynamic KPI Dashboard** ‚Äì Automatic updates for distance, duration, and vehicle-specific metrics

  * Car/Motorcycle ‚Üí Fuel (L) and Cost (‚Ç±)
  * Bike ‚Üí Calories and Average Speed
  * Walking ‚Üí Steps and Calories
  * E-Bike ‚Üí Energy (Wh/kWh) and Charge Cost
* **Turn-By-Turn Directions** ‚Äì Icon-based instructions for left, right, u-turn, roundabout, and arrival steps
* **Highlighted Destination** ‚Äì Final ‚ÄúArrive at destination‚Äù step visually emphasized
* **Dark/Light Mode Support** ‚Äì Built-in theme toggle
* **Loading Progress** ‚Äì Animated loader while generating routes

---

## **Requirements**

* Modern browser (Edge, Chrome, or Firefox)
* Internet connection for GraphHopper API access
* GraphHopper API key (free tier available at [https://www.graphhopper.com](https://www.graphhopper.com))

## **Installation**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Group-Saisys
   ```

2. Install dependencies (if using the Python helper tools):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your API key:

   ```bash
   # On Windows
   set GRAPHHOPPER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

   # On Linux/Mac
   export GRAPHHOPPER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   Alternatively, create a `.env` file (see `.env.example`).

---

## **Usage**

Run the main web file:

```bash
start index.html
```

or open it directly in your browser.

1. Enter your **Origin** (e.g., ‚ÄúBatangas City Hall‚Äù)
2. Enter your **Destination** (e.g., ‚ÄúSM City Batangas‚Äù)
3. Select a **Vehicle Type** (Car, Motorcycle, Bike, Foot, or E-Bike)
4. Click **Generate Report**

The application will:

* Display a suggested route on the map
* Show a **üìç pin** for origin and **green flag** for destination
* Present detailed KPIs and turn-by-turn directions

---

## **Default Values**

The application uses Philippine market defaults (as of October 2025):

* **Gasoline**: ‚Ç±57.20 / L
* **Electricity**: ‚Ç±12.00 / kWh
* **Fuel Efficiency**: 7.0 L / 100 km
* **Body Weight**: 70 kg
* **Steps per km**: 1,250

---

## **Report Features**

Generated route reports include:

* Interactive Leaflet map visualization
* Start and end location markers
* Distance (km / mi) and estimated duration
* Fuel consumption and cost (motorized modes)
* Calorie or energy estimation for active transport
* Icon-coded turn instructions
* Highlighted destination step

---

## **Future Enhancements**

* Multi-route comparison (shortest vs scenic)
* Real-time traffic and weather overlays
* Export route summaries (PDF or CSV)
* Optional user profiles with saved routes
